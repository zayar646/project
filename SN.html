                  <i><h3 style="color: yellowgreen;">Recipe for this dish</h3></i>
              <ul>
                  <li>First, Put the vermicelli and noodles in a large bowl, and cover with boiling water. As they soften, use two forks to separate the strands. When fully softened, drain them in a colander, and set aside.</li><br><br>
                  <li>Rub the chicken with the fish sauce and set aside.</li><br>
                  <li>Dissolve the chickpea flour in the water and set aside.</li><br><br>
                  <li>In a food processor, blend together the onions, garlic, turmeric, ginger, and chilies. When well-blended, add 1/4 cup of the coconut cream, and process to a smooth paste.</li><br><br>
                  <li>Heat the peanut oil in a pan large enough to hold all the soup ingredients. Add the paste and fry for 3 minutes, stirring constantly. Add the chicken and continue frying for another 3 minutes, still stirring. Add half the stock (2 1/2 cups) and one stock cube, if used, and bring to a boil. Continue cooking for another 15-20 minutes. Stir every 5 minutes. You want the sauce to start thickening.</li><br><br>
                  <li>While the soup is cooking, prepare the garnishes, and set aside, also heat the other half of the stock (and a second stock cube, if used) in another pan until it starts to boil. Add the dissolved (and stirred again) chickpea flour/water mixture, still stirring well to minimize lumps. When this thickens some (about 5 minutes) pour this mixture through a sieve into the pan containing the chicken mixture. Stir well. (The sieve is important -- no matter how much you stir, there are still a few lumps.).</li><br><br>
                  <li>When the soup just starts to boil, add the remaining coconut cream. Then bring soup back to a rolling boil.</li><br><br>
