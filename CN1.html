                    <h2 >WHAT IS COCONUT NOODLE?</h2>
                </i>
                      <p>Ohn no kauk swe is undoubtedly the most famous Burmese recipe after mohinga.<br><br>Ohn no kauk swe translates to “noodles with coconut milk.” Noodles, as well as rice are a staple in this region of Asia, as much as baguette is in France.<br><br>Also called Ohn no khao swe, on no khauk swe, Ohn no khauk sway, Ohn no khau sway and Ohn no khau swe, but if it you think it is hard to pronounce, you can just call it "Coconut Noodle".<br><br>This simple dish consists of wheat noodles in a chicken curry and coconut milk base. This dish is often topped with crunchy fried rice noodles, sliced raw onions, hot pepper, and boiled egg.<br>
                      They are the secret of this delicious meal. This dish can be served as either soup or curry. While making this noodle, some believe that coconut milk contributes to high blood pressure,<br><br>and because of that, people tend to avoid it and use evaporated milk instead. But it is still delicious in both versions. We can also make this dish with or without meat. If we make it<br><br>without meat, it is a simple vegan supper, perfect for feeding the family or friends! Most of the Burmese people eat this as breakfast but breakfast, lunch, or dinner, it's your choice.<br><br>This easy, comforting noodle soup brings a little spice and cool coconut flavors and takes just 15 minutes to make, perfect for a speedy lunch!</p>
                  <i><h3 style="color: yellowgreen;">Recipe for this dish</h3></i>
              <ul>
                  <li>First, Put the vermicelli and noodles in a large bowl, and cover with boiling water. As they soften, use two forks to separate the strands. When fully softened, drain them in a colander, and set aside.</li><br><br>
                  <li>Rub the chicken with the fish sauce and set aside.</li><br>
                  <li>Dissolve the chickpea flour in the water and set aside.</li><br><br>
                  <li>In a food processor, blend together the onions, garlic, turmeric, ginger, and chilies. When well-blended, add 1/4 cup of the coconut cream, and process to a smooth paste.</li><br><br>
                  <li>Heat the peanut oil in a pan large enough to hold all the soup ingredients. Add the paste and fry for 3 minutes, stirring constantly. Add the chicken and continue frying for another 3 minutes, still stirring. Add half the stock (2 1/2 cups) and one stock cube, if used, and bring to a boil. Continue cooking for another 15-20 minutes. Stir every 5 minutes. You want the sauce to start thickening.</li><br><br>
                  <li>While the soup is cooking, prepare the garnishes, and set aside, also heat the other half of the stock (and a second stock cube, if used) in another pan until it starts to boil. Add the dissolved (and stirred again) chickpea flour/water mixture, still stirring well to minimize lumps. When this thickens some (about 5 minutes) pour this mixture through a sieve into the pan containing the chicken mixture. Stir well. (The sieve is important -- no matter how much you stir, there are still a few lumps.).</li><br><br>
                  <li>When the soup just starts to boil, add the remaining coconut cream. Then bring soup back to a rolling boil.</li><br><br>
                  <li>While the soup is returning to a rolling boil, bring a full 2-liter kettle of water to the boil, then pour the hot water over the vermicelli and egg noodles you softened earlier. Get the garnishes ready to serve.</li><br><br>
                  <li>Attack with a spoon and fork while the soup is hot. And let the soup travel into your stomach!</li><br><br>
                  <li>And guess what, you have got your super-duper delicious dinner~</li>
