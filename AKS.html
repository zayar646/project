         <h2> What is A Kyaw Sone?</h2>
  <p style="color: lightyellow;">It is a favorite street food which is usually served for breakfast and Burmese people love to enjoy it together<br><br>with the steam rice or a cup of coffee. You can also have it as a snack when you get hungry<br><br> in the middle of the night. They are typically served as standalone snacks dipped in a sour-sweet tamarind-based sauce,<br><br> or as toppings for common Burmese dishes. Gourd, chickpea, and onion fritters are cut into small parts<br><br> and eaten with mohinga, Myanmar's national dish. These fritters are also eaten with kauk hnyin baung rice <br><br>and with a Burmese green sauce called chin-saw-gar (ချဉ်စော်ကား) or a-chin-yay (အချဉ်ရည်). Depending on the fritter hawker,<br><br>the sauce is made from chili sauce diluted with vinegar, water, cilantro, finely diced tomatoes, garlic, and onions.<br><br> If you love Japanese tempura and Indian Baji, you will definitely love Burmese Fritters too. So, we made a recipe in case <br>you wanna try that!</p>

<i><h3 style="color: cyan; text-decoration: underline;">Recipe for Mote Lone Yay Baw </h3></i>
  <li> Mix well all the ingredients except water. Add water slowly and mix to be a batter. Don't over mix the batter. Some lumps in the batter are fine. Set the batter aside for 30 mins while preparing the veggies. Thinly slice onion, cut chayoke into 2-3cm (about 1.18 in) long pieces, take the green part of spring onion and cut and thin slice potato. If you aren't using frozen corn, you will have to cut kernels off cob.</li><br><br>
<li> Heat up the oil in medium heat. Transfer the potato in a bowl and add about 1/2 cup of batter, then combine well. Stir the batter each time before using it. Take about 2-3 slices of potato with coated batter and fry at medium-low heat till it is cooked and light yellow on both sides.</li><br><br>
<li> Increase to high flame for crispy and light brown surface. Drain the Oil and continue to fry till potato is finished. Use the same bowl, add chayote, and mix with batter. Spread a spoonful of chayote at the corner of a small plate, then push into the oil with a spoon to form a flat fritter. Fry the same process as potato fritter and drain the oil.</li><br><br>
<li> Continue to mix the rest of the veggies with batter and scoop with a spoon to fry them. For Dipping sauce, pound garlic, ginger, chili in pestle and mortar, then add palm sugar and salt. Give a few more pounds. Pour in the tamarind mixture. Add chili sauce and sprinkle with chopped coriander. Now you’ve got your new favorite snack: A Kyaw Sone</li>
