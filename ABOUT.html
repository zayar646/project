            flavor, even within the same dish â€“ <br>for example, a bowl of Mandalay Meeshay will contain tender rice noodles, crunchy-sour pickles, beansprouts that snap to the bite, and meltingly<br>
            rich morsels of pork. They are wholesome, nutritious, and filled with the right amount of carbs,<br> proteins, and vitamins. They are just different from the others.If you wanna feel happy,<br>
